The library is a wrapper around the 4chan API that allows you to access information in an object-oriented way, which we will see is very useful. The library contains 3 main objects: ```board```, ```thread```, and ```post```. At a top level, a ```board``` contains all the ```threads``` in that borad, and a ```thread``` contains all the ```files``` and ```posts``` in that thread. ```posts``` also contain any ```files``` that are attached to that specific post. No prequisites are required to use the library."
