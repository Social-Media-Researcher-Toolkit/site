# Introduction 
Welcome to ***Signals in the Noise: Python Tools for Social Media Data***, an online resource for collecting and analyzing social media content. This resource is designed to provide accessible tutorials to request social media content from application programming interfaces, clean and structure such text into data, and perform analysis of the contents.

Social media has become the most important space to understand current discourse about important topics that impact our lives. From politics to fandom, from breaking news to misinformation, social media plays a central role in providing space to communicate about such topics. For researchers, social media represents a vibrant data source for analysis.
 
The website features the Python programming language for scholars and students working on projects that require analysis of social media and will be especially interesting to people working in digital media studies, critical internet studies, information studies, and other digital research areas.

***Signals in the Noise*** features codebooks for working with Telegram, YouTube, Reddit, and 4chan, with more codebooks coming! Each codebook includes step-by-step instructions to use Python to access and analyze text from these sites. This book includes interactive Python code that can be run in the book or copied and applied in your own code.   

## Acknowledgments
***Signals in the Noise*** was generously funded by the J. Troutner Innovative Educators Program Award. We would also like to acknowledge the Purdue University Library and School of Information Studies as well as the work of Dr. Melanie Walsh who published the Introduction to Cultural Analytics & Python textbook and the AI for Humanists Project. Both of these projects are important resources.
